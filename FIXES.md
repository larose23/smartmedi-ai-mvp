# SmartMedi AI MVP - Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

1. **Type Inconsistencies**
   - Consolidated the `CheckIn` interface in types/triage.ts to support multiple variations used across the codebase
   - Fixed conflicting types for symptoms properties (arrays vs strings)
   - Added proper type handling for optional fields

2. **Component Errors**
   - Fixed `PatientProfile` component loading state issues
   - Fixed `ViewDetailsModal` component to use the proper CheckIn interface
   - Fixed UI components like Calendar and DateRangePicker to use the correct props
   - Fixed QRCodeGenerator by installing the missing dependency

3. **Data Processing**
   - Enhanced data handling in lib/ai-triage.ts to safely handle string/array conversions
   - Fixed diagnostic system to properly handle different impact_on_activities formats
   - Improved triage analysis to handle different symptom formats

4. **Dashboard Integration**
   - Created a DashboardCheckIn interface that works with the existing UI components
   - Added adapter functions to convert between different CheckIn representations
   - Fixed data fetching and formatting in the dashboard

## Remaining Issues

1. **Test Files**
   - The test files (__tests__/triage.test.ts) have missing dependencies (vitest)
   - Test files import functions that are not exported from their modules

2. **API Error Handling**
   - Several API routes have TypeScript errors related to handling 'unknown' error types
   - These are TypeScript best practices but won't prevent the code from running

3. **Supabase API Usage**
   - app/api/insert-check-in/route.ts uses an `.execute` method that may be from an older Supabase API

## Next Steps

To fully address all issues, the following actions are recommended:

1. Update the test infrastructure by:
   - Installing vitest and configuring it properly
   - Exporting the functions needed for testing or refactoring the tests

2. Improve error handling in API routes by:
   - Adding proper type checking for errors
   - Using TypeScript's type guards for error handling

3. Update the Supabase API usage:
   - Review the Supabase documentation for the latest API patterns
   - Update any deprecated method calls
