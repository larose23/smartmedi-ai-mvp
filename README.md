## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smartmedi-ai-mvp.git
   cd smartmedi-ai-mvp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Fill in your Supabase credentials

4. Set up Supabase:
   - Create a new Supabase project
   - Create a `check_ins` table with the following schema:
     ```sql
     create table check_ins (
       id uuid default uuid_generate_v4() primary key,
       full_name text not null,
       date_of_birth timestamp with time zone not null,
       contact_info text not null,
       primary_symptom text not null,
       additional_symptoms text,
       triage_score text not null,
       created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
     );
     ```

5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## User Journeys

### Patient Flow
