# Production Configuration Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the improvements made to the SmartMedi-AI application's production configuration to enhance stability, handle port conflicts, and prevent resource leaks.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Custom Server Implementation

A new custom server implementation has been added in `server.js` that provides:

- **Automatic Port Conflict Resolution**: If the specified port is in use, the server will automatically try the next available port
- **Connection Tracking**: Tracks active connections to ensure proper cleanup on server shutdown
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Properly handles SIGTERM and SIGINT signals to ensure clean server termination
- **Database Connection Management**: Maintains a shared database connection for all requests

### 2. Enhanced Database Connection Handling

The Supabase client implementation has been improved to:

- **Track Active Requests**: Monitors all in-flight requests to ensure they can be properly terminated
- **Implement Request Timeouts**: Automatically terminates long-running requests to prevent hanging connections
- **Resource Cleanup**: Properly cleans up resources on application shutdown
- **Connection Health Checks**: Periodically verifies database connectivity

### 3. Development Environment Improvements

- **Auto Port Selection**: The `dev:auto` script automatically finds an available port if the default one is in use
- **Graceful Termination**: Properly handles termination signals during development

## Usage

### Production Deployment

To start the application in production mode:

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start with custom server (auto port selection)
npm start

# If needed, fallback to standard server on fixed port
npm run start:fallback
```

### Development Mode

```bash
# Standard development mode (port 3009)
npm run dev

# Auto port selection if 3009 is in use
npm run dev:auto

# Windows-specific development mode (port 3015)
npm run dev:win
```

## Resource Management

The enhanced configuration provides several mechanisms to prevent resource leaks:

1. **Request Tracking**: All Supabase requests are tracked and properly aborted on shutdown
2. **Timeout Management**: All timeouts are tracked and cleared on shutdown
3. **Connection Pooling**: A single shared Supabase connection is used across the server

## Health Checks

The application now includes a database health check during initialization that:

1. Verifies connectivity to the Supabase database
2. Checks schema validity
3. Measures response time for monitoring purposes

## Troubleshooting

If you experience port conflicts with the automatic port selection:

1. Try using `npm run dev:auto` which will find an available port automatically
2. Manually specify a different port: `npx next dev -p 3030`
3. Check for processes using your desired port: `netstat -ano | findstr :<PORT>`

For database connection issues, the application will now provide more detailed error messages and will attempt to recover gracefully.
